Basic Command Line Calculator
This project is a straightforward and powerful command-line calculator designed to help beginners understand and implement essential programming concepts. It serves as an excellent starting point for anyone looking to learn how to structure a program, organize logic, and interact with users through the command line.

The calculator performs a range of mathematical operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more advanced functions like square roots and trigonometric calculations. The core idea is to explain the logic behind each operation and to break down complex tasks into simple, manageable functions.

By exploring this project, beginners can:

Learn how to structure a program with clear and organized functions that handle specific tasks.
Understand the flow of user input and how to guide users through different options with conditionals and loops.
Implement essential mathematical operations and learn how to code them in a way that makes them reusable and easy to modify.
Build confidence in coding basics like data types, function calls, and loops, all in a practical, real-world context.
This project not only demonstrates the power of functions in programming but also provides a solid foundation for anyone looking to dive deeper into more complex coding concepts.
